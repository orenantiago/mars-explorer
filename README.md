This is my solution to Elo7's technical [challenge](https://gist.github.com/elo7-developer/1a40c96a5d062b69f02c). A postman documentation to help clarify how to use the API can be found [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2581871/TVCfWTSX). 

## How to Run the project
### Requirements
The requirements to run this projects are Java 1.8, docker and docker-compose.

### Running the project
To run the project, you must go to the main folder, and run the following commands:     
```./gradlew build```    
```sudo docker-compose up```     
Then, the application will be (fingers crossed) succesfully running and available for connections in the port 8080 of the localhost.
